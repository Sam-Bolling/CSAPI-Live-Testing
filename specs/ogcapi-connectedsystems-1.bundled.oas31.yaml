  - name: Collections
    description: |-
      Collections allow a client to discover available resources in a way that is conformant with OGC API Features
      and OGC API Common.

      All Connected Systems resource types are always available through their canonical collections at the service root,
      but OGC API Collections provide an additional way of grouping and accessing these resources.
      In particular, Collections allow a service provider to group resources logically according to any criteria.

      For example, collections can be used to:
        - Group all `Systems` of the same type (e.g., all UAV platforms, all hydrological sensors, etc.).
        - Group all `Procedures` of the same type (e.g., all platform types, all CBRNE sensor models, etc.).
        - Group resources by project (e.g., all `Deployments`, `Systems`, `Datastreams` and `Sampling Features` relevant to a given data acquisition campaign)
  - name: Systems
    description: |-
      Systems are entities that can produce data feeds and/or receive commands (e.g., sensors and sensor networks, platforms, actuators,
      processing components, etc.). Many systems can be classified as 'observing systems' that produce observations of one or more
      features of interest.
  - name: Deployments
    description: Deployments describe how systems are being deployed at a particular place and time.
  - name: Procedures
    description: |-
      Procedures provide information about the behavior of a system to accomplish its task(s).
      Procedures include descriptions of system kinds (e.g., a hardware device's datasheet), as well as methodologies or specific
      configurations of these systems (e.g., steps followed by an operator to accomplish a sensing or sampling task).
  - name: Sampling Features
    description: |-
      Sampling Features link Systems with ultimate features of interest, describing exactly what part of a larger feature is being
      interacted with.
  - name: Properties
    description: |-
      Property resources provide the definitions of derived properties that are used throughout the API.

      Derived properties are specific to a type of feature, a type of system, or even to a particular organization, project or deployment.
      Property definitions are referenced by feature schemas, system and deployment descriptions, datastream and control stream schemas, etc.

      Depending on the context they are used in, they can represent properties that are asserted (e.g., system characteristic), observed
      (observed or observable property) or controlled (controlled or controllable property).

        An array of extents is provided for each extent type (spatial, temporal). The first item
        in the array describes the overall extent of the data. All subsequent items describe more
        precise extents, e.g., to identify clusters of data. Clients only interested in the
        overall extent will only need to access the first extent in the array.

                The first bounding box describes the overall spatial
                extent of the data. All subsequent bounding boxes describe
                more precise bounding boxes, e.g., to identify clusters of data.

                  Each bounding box is provided as four or six numbers, depending on
                  whether the coordinate reference system includes a vertical axis
                  (height or depth):

                  * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1
                  * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2
                  * Minimum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)
                  * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1
                  * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2
                  * Maximum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)

                  If the value consists of four numbers, the coordinate reference system is
                  WGS 84 longitude/latitude (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84)
                  unless a different coordinate reference system is specified in `crs`.

                  If the value consists of six numbers, the coordinate reference system is WGS 84
                  longitude/latitude/ellipsoidal height (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/CRS84h)
                  unless a different coordinate reference system is specified in `crs`.

                  For WGS 84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases the sequence of
                  minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum latitude.
                  However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the first value
                  (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value (east-most box edge).

                  If the vertical axis is included, the third and the sixth number are
                  the bottom and the top of the 3-dimensional bounding box.

                  If a feature has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is the decision of the
                  server whether only a single spatial geometry property is used to determine
                  the extent or all relevant geometries.

    bbox:
      name: bbox
      in: query
      description: |-
        The bounding box is provided as four or six numbers, depending on whether the
        coordinate reference system includes a vertical axis (height or depth).

        Only features that have a geometry that intersects the bounding box are selected.

        The order of coordinates is as follow:

        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1
        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2
        * Minimum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)
        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1
        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2
        * Maximum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)

        If the value consists of four numbers, the coordinate reference system is
        WGS 84 longitude/latitude (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84)
        unless a different coordinate reference system is specified in the parameter `bbox-crs`.

        If the value consists of six numbers, the coordinate reference system is WGS 84 
        longitude/latitude/ellipsoidal height (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/CRS84h)
        unless a different coordinate reference system is specified in the parameter `bbox-crs`.

        The query parameter `bbox-crs` is specified in OGC API - Features - Part 2: Coordinate 
        Reference Systems by Reference.

        For WGS 84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases the sequence of
        minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum latitude.
        However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the first value
        (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value (east-most box edge).

        If the vertical axis is included, the third and the sixth number are the
        bottom and the top of the 3-dimensional bounding box.

        If a feature has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is the decision of the
        server whether only a single spatial geometry property is used to determine
        the extent or all relevant geometries.
